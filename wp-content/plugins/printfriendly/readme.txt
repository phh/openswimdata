== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I set the button to align left / right and it doesn't align right! =
Check whether your theme includes the [required CSS class](http://codex.wordpress.org/CSS#WordPress_Generated_Classes), PrintFriendly uses these to align your button. If that doesn't work for you, uncheck the "Add CSS to Pages" checkbox and style the button yourself.

= The Print Friendly button is loading but it's not doing anything, what's wrong? =
Check the "JavaScript fallback" checkbox in the settings and check again. If the button starts working now, the JavaScript isn't loading correctly. Check your source for a mention of `cdn.printfriendly.com/printfriendly.js`. If it's not there, make sure your theme has the required [wp_footer](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) call. 

= Some of the input fields in the admin are disabled! =
If you've disabled the loading of CSS and / or set "Add PrintFriendly To" to Manual, some of the input boxes will be disabled as you've basically disabled that functionality.

= I'm manually adding the button but it's aligning wrong! =
If you're getting unexpected results, you might want to set Horizontal Alignment to "None".

= I still need help! =
