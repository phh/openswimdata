BULLET THEME DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

RENAMING THE THEME

It's important you find and replace the theme name with case sensitive set to on, so that classes start with a capital letter.


USING LESS

Compile these files from /less to /css using a LESS app

- styles.less (Base stylesheet)
- media-queries.less (media queries for increasingly larger sizes)
- ie.less (loads all the css from the forst 4 media queries, so old IE gets all the large screen css)
- admin_styles.less (only if you want to add styles to the backend)
